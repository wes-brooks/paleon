##Bret's suggestions on Tweedie problem:

###Present the minimal example problem
This could be a Tweedie GLM with constant coefficients or maybe a straight-up parameter estimation (MLE). The goal is to make the issue clear without losing anyone in the details of the 



###Review
 * Talk about current state of the art (What do people do now?) (e.g. guessing, "delta" method)
 * Present deficiencies of current state of the art (why should we want something better? How do the currently available methods break down?)

###Present my idea
 * Available results
 * How are they justified?
 * How robust is the current work?

###Be prepared for questions
 * How would I frame my idea in a theoretical framework?
 * What results do I expect to be able to prove?
 * What asymptotic results will I need to prove?
