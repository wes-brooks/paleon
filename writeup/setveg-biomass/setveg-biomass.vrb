\verb!COZIGAM!: an alternative for fitting the two-stage model
  \begin{itemize}
    \item COZIGAM stands for constrained zero-inflated GAM
    \item ``Constrained" means that the latent predictors for the $P(y=0)$ part and the $f(y|y>0)$ part must be proportional
    \item Package was removed from CRAN last year
    \item In testing with the archived version, algorithm convergence was elusive
  \end{itemize}
